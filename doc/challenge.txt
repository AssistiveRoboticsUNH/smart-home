IoT:

---1.Motion sensor: same sensor used in two sinarios. The different range could't be configured. 
---Idea: use different time schedule as different purpose. 

2.If the AWD open the door and never close it, the robot would be always trigger to go towards the door.

Robot:

1. If the body is too high, the laser sensor can't detect blocked way.

2. If the AWD is facing an object, than the current person finding routin cannot recognize him/her.

3. Need a domain expert to model the robot behavious, i.e., someone have to write the PDDL model.
   ad-hoc idea: model for current specific senarios by tianyi and sajay
   research direction: do the task planning in a general way

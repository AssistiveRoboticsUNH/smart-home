# smart-home

The project is about i) designing a smart home equipped with a socially assistive robot (SAR) and serval
internet of things (IoT) devices and ii) evaluating the feasibility of using such a smart home to care for
elderly people with dementia. The SAR will execute a range of autonomous behaviors to communicate
with the occupant of the smart home as well as all IoT devices to ensure health and well-being of the

# Smart Home Robot
The project is about i) designing a smart home equipped with a socially assistive robot (SAR) and serval
internet of things (IoT) devices and ii) evaluating the feasibility of using such a smart home to care for
elderly people with dementia. The SAR will execute a range of autonomous behaviors to communicate
with the occupant of the smart home as well as all IoT devices to ensure health and well-being of the
elderly occupant and the safety of the home.

Add this to .bashr or .zshrc  
* on board labtop
'''bash
# need to add this to onboard labtop that runs roscore
export ROS_IP=0.0.0.0

# set to localhost for onboard labtop that runs roscore
export ROS_MASTER_URI=http://localhost:11311

# IP of onboard labtop that runs roscore
export ROS_HOSTNAME=10.21.152.74
'''

* remote control pc or labtop
'''bash
# IP of onboard labtop that runs roscore
export ROS_MASTER_URI=http://10.21.152.74:11311

# IP of remote pc 
export ROS_HOSTNAME=10.21.98,194
'''
